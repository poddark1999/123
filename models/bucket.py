class Bucket(Model):
    '''
    The Bucket class models the goals that a user aims to attain, represented as "buckets".
    Each bucket has a financial target amount, a deadline, a user_UUID,
    a current_amount (standing for the amount which has already been allocated)
    and additional meta information.
